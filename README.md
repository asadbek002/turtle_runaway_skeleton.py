The game starts with the runner and the chaser positioned at a distance from each other. The objective of the game is for the runner to avoid being caught by the chaser and the villain while navigating the game area. The game includes features like different difficulty levels, visual elements (castle, bushes), and the possibility of adding a logo for an educational institution (Seoul National University in this case).

Players can control the runner's movements in manual mode or let the chaser and villain move automatically in different directions. The game provides feedback on whether the runner was caught or not.
